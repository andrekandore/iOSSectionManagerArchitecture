iOSSectionManagerArchitecture
=============================

This is not intended as a template for new projects, but as a working example of using view models and 'section managers' to cleanly separate the responsiblity of the parts of your iOS app.  You may be able to use it to bootstrap a new project quickly though.

We often work on projects which are passed between teams of developers, and having design patterns which are far too abstract and complex leads to more problems than it solves; I believe it strikes a good balance between being effective and readily understandable.

Play around with it and see what you think - it's intended to be a work in progress so I'd be glad to hear any ideas on what to improve.
